Notes from meeting in NYC:

* We wanted to return early in the case of fast failure like rubocop and we
  figured out how to hack it together in 1.0, but 2.0's workflows more closely
  matched what we wanted to do.

* start by describing the series of events.

* do a gist of full config file, but also get the workflows part embedded.

Random thoughts today:

* don't feel like you have to explain everything about Circle CI 2.0 - it's ok
  to link to their docs.

* how do we talk about Volt externally? should i refer to it as our CMS for
  galleries?

* something like
  [this](https://circleci.com/workflow-run/a2085d22-0737-4eaf-a363-666c483de278)
  would make a good visual for the post.

* there's lots of good content to steal from
  [here](https://github.com/artsy/volt/pull/2797)

* This should be the commit that had the
  [config](https://github.com/artsy/volt/commit/1c3a7f36fce5bc4045c6f53509ea7ec9c5704010)
  to use for making the gist.
